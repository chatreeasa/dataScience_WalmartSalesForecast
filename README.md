# dataScience_WalmartSalesForecast

The Walmart Sales Forecasting project is a machine learning project that predicts the weekly sales of 45 Walmart stores based on historical data. The objective of this project is to create a regression model that accurately predicts the weekly sales for each store, allowing Walmart to plan and manage their resources efficiently.

In this project, we have used five regression models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression, and XGBoost Regression. We have evaluated their performance using two evaluation metrics: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

The Walmart Sales Forecasting project is an excellent example of how machine learning can be used to improve business operations and decision-making. By accurately predicting the weekly sales, Walmart can plan their resources efficiently, optimize their inventory levels, and make informed decisions to improve their business performance.

We hope that this project will inspire and encourage data enthusiasts to explore the world of machine learning and its application in real-life scenarios.
